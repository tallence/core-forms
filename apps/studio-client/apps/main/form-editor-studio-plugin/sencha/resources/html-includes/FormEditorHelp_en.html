        The form is created using the different form elements.
        There is a distinction between simple elements and element groups (complex elements). Element groups are
        collections of multiple elements.
        Below you can find a simple explanation for the usage of the editor.
        For each element, you can select whether it is mandatory, add a hint which is shown to the right of an element.
